 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel like jumping straight into this assignment was hard. I was confused for the first few days after receiving the assignment and only started to somewhat understand it after going to TA hours. I feel like this homework assignment would've went better if we were given more time in class to talk about it. During the time we did have I feel like other students were just as confused as me and didnt really know what exaclty to ask so we just tried to reflect and come up with questions based off the rubric. I think It would've been more proactive to see an example of how we should've started on the assignment in class. My advice would be to start early and create study groups ASAP. Even if the instructions seem simple the actual coding part of our homeworks will take up more time than expected. Being in a study group helps because having more than one perspective on our tasks helps encourage us to develop the team working skills we'll need after college. Overall I dont feel like this assignment reflects my true abilities as a programmer because If I weren't as confused as I still am on it I would've put  out a functional code.
